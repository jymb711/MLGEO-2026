## Notes

In class, we discussed:
1. Integrated development environments (specifically for this course, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)).
2. Setting up Python, virtual environments, and using Jupyter notebooks.

    You can access the course's JupyterHub instance [here](https://jupyter.rttl.uw.edu/2026-winter-ess-469-a/). If you are so inclined, [you can connect to this instance using VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_connect-to-a-remote-jupyter-server).

3. Version control (specifically, the fundamentals of ```git```).
4. Formatting documents using Markdown.

    As I mentioned in class, there are many guides to Markdown syntax available on the internet. One especially useful resource is [Writing on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github). 

5. Details about the final project.
