## Objectives

In order to develop collaborations and, ultimately, assemble groups for the final project, it is important to know something about your fellow students. 

For this assignment, you will assemble **up to two slides** that tell us:

1. Your name.
2. Your department.
3. An aspect of the geosciences that especially interests you.
4. Your long-term goals. 
5. Experiences you may have with AI/ML.

Please put your completed slides into [this document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/104johrIJ4_nh40i673fsOVwcJtfAkBH918SZ5CY4ZHs/edit?usp=share_link) You should feel free to edit directly in the document.

**You will have exactly one minute to present your slides to the class.** I will *strictly* enforce this time limit.

## Deadline

You should complete your slides by <u>**9:00 AM on Friday, January 9**</u>. You will present your slides in class that day. 

## Follow up

After everyone presents on Friday, you will have one week to assemble groups for the final project.
